 Infrastructure for the organisation master account.  This account contains the IAM users and roles.

 ## Getting Started - Local Setup
 `PolyDev` exposes the tools that can be used to define and provision AWS resources and is the recommened approach rather than installing and maintaining tools installed locally on your PC.
  
 Here is the list of tools we use to provision the `organisation account` infrastructure:
 * [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault)
 * [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

 ### Setup AWS Vault and PolyDev
 If you haven't done so already setup your local PC with AWS Vault and PolyDev as described in the docs https://github.com/ifunky/polydev.
 At this point you will have:
 * AWS Vault installed with a basic profile based on your AWS username
 * Docker and PolyDev running from your shell

 ### Setup AWS Role
  __NOTE:__ This is a one time setup required for this specific account.
  Add an additional AWS profile in `~/.aws/config`. Make sure to change username (username) to your own.
  ```bash
  [profile ifunky-master-core-account]
  source_profile=ifunky-ro
  role_arn=arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/master_account_adminstrator
  mfa_serial=arn:aws:iam::123456789:mfa/username

  ```
  __NOTE:__ You must have been added to the correct IAM group by an administrator which allows you to assume the role specfified in the profile

  ## Console Login
  This account contains the IAM users and Groups for the whole organisation.  Member accounts do not have any users, instead a role must be "assumed" in order to elevate permissions.
  Login to the console here: https://682858061982.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
  
  ### Switching Roles
  The following roles are available for switching to:
  - https://signin.aws.amazon.com/switchrole?roleName=master_account_adminstrator&account=682858061982   

  ## Terraform Account Creation
  When creating a new set of resources/accounts for the first time we do the following:

  - Delete all default VPCs in every region
  - Setup the minimal amount of infrastructure in order for the Terraform state to be initialised

  To intialise the Terraform code the following must be executed from the shell in order to setup the Terraform backend make sure you have completed the following checklist:

  - Updated/verified `environments/common.tf` with the relevant configuration for this account
  - You have been granted admin rights to this account and AWS Vault has been configured correctly

  **To Initialise Terraform**

  - Enter the `PolyDev` shell:

          $ make dockerdev

  - Run the following commands 
  
          $ make init-proj
      
  After the process has successfully completed the Terraform state will be ready and you can commit/push the repo in order to use the Change Management Pipeline.

    ## Destroy All Resources
  For safety some resources can't be deleted automatically, if you really want to nuke everything manually empty the following S3 bucket: 
  - companyname.{environment}.terraform
  
    From within the PolyDev shell run the following command which will prompt you for confirmation:

      $ make destroy

    Good bye infrastructure :-)
